## Overview
If you have any decimal values in the position value of a frame, Figma rounds up that pixel on export to PNG, and you get a white line along the edge of the exported asset. To avoid this, you need to round off all the decimal values manually, which is a pain. This plugin does it for you!

The Plugin is designed to round off decimal values in the `x` and `y` position properties of all top-level frames on the current page, or only those selected. Never see that little white edge line bug again!
